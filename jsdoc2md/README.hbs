# rsa-acc

This is an implementation of a cryptographic accumulator over the RSA cryptosystem.

Features:

* __Constant time accumulation__: Updating the accumulation does not require access
to all previously accumulated values.
* __Constant size accumulation__: Components of the accumulation are constant size.
* __Trustless proofs__: An untrusted prover may compute a witness of membership
for any accumulated element without knowledge of any sensitive information.
* __Constant time witness updates__: Updating witness does not require access
to all previously accumulated values.

## Setup

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/johnoliverdriscoll/rsa-acc
$ cd rsa-acc
$ npm install
```

## Tutorial

Constructing an accumulator requires generating an RSA key (a random key is generated
if you do not give it one).

```javascript
// Import rsa-acc.
const {Accumulator, updateWitness} = require('rsa-acc')
// An algorithm used to map data to elements in Z_q.
const hash = 'sha256'
// Construct a trusted accumulator.
const accumulator = new Accumulator(hash)
```

When adding an element, the accumulator returns a witness that can be used to verify
its membership later.

```javascript
// Add an element.
const d1 = '1'
const u1 = accumulator.add(d1)
// Verify the result.
assert(accumulator.verify(u1))
```

Subsequent additions of elements invalidate the previously returned witnesses. 

```javascript
// Add a new element.
const d2 = '2'
const u2 = accumulator.add(d2)
// Verify the result.
assert(accumulator.verify(u2))
// Demonstrate that the witness for d1 is no longer valid.
assert(accumulator.verify(u1) === false)
```

Previous witnesses can be updated using the witnesses returned from subsequent
additions.

```javascript
// Update the witness for d1.
const w1 = updateWitness(H, u2, u1)
// Verify the result.
assert(accumulator.verify(w1))
```

An element can be deleted from the accumulator, which invalidates its witness.

```javascript
// Delete d1 from the accumulator.
const u3 = accumulator.del(w1)
// Demonstrate that the original witness is no longer valid.
assert(accumulator.verify(w1) === false)
```

Previous witnesses must be updated after a deletion as well.

```javascript
// Update the witness for the remaining element.
const w2 = updateWitness(H, u3, w1)
// Demonstrate that the new witness is valid.
assert(accumulator.verify(w2))
```

The witness for the deleted item will not be valid until it is added to the
accumulator again.

```javascript
// Update the witness for the deleted element.
const w3 = updateWitness(H, u3, u2)
// Demonstrate that the new witness is not valid either.
assert(accumulator.verify(w3) === false)
```
